Earthquake Visualization
========================================================

I chose to use the USGS database on global earthquake activity as the basis for the shiny app 

Users will have the ability to
- Select the range of years to include
- Select the range of earthquake magnitudes to include 

Output includes
- A world map with earthquake activity meeting the criteria
- A histogram of earthquake magnitudes meeting the criteria

The source data can be found [here](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/)  
Additional documentation on the data catalog can be found [here](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/doc_aboutdata.php)


App Interface

Here is a screen shot of the app interface and world map
